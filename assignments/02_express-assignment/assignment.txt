    -   Create an npm project and install Express.js, Nodemon if you want.
    -   Create an Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions
        that log something to the console and return one response.
    -   Handle requests to "/" and "/users" such that each request only has one 
        handler/middleware that does something with it (e.g. send dummy response)
